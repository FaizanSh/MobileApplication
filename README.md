#Problem Statement
With so many sources available to make oneself aware of the facts and information people
usually get distracted and follow something that is not worth of their time. And some time they
require information from multiple sources, which make them so much irritated because to follow
multiple platform they need to download multiple apps of different news channels and login to
each of them make them frustrated, not interested to information anymore. That is the reason
why social media apps are so popular because they provide diverse information although most
of the information is junk, but diversity attracts the user and make them come again and again,
every time in the quest of discovering something new and compulsive. With limited computing
resources available in the mobile phone, downloading all the news application is impossible for
some who is an ardent reader and news follower.

#Proposed Solution
Every problem has a solution, it just only needs to be discovered. My aim is to provide users and
passionate readers with a platform where they have access to all the articles from their favorite
news sites. So, they cannot miss the useful information which everybody is getting. For this
purpose, I’m using an API named as ‘NEWSAPI’. It is use for news analysis and article discovery,
but we can intelligently use it for displaying popular article from more than 30,000 sources, for
our ease, only on a single screen.
‘NewsApi’ indexes every recent news and blog article from all our favorite sites, and with our
proposed application we can get access to it easily through a single interface.NewAPI only needs an HTTP request through which it’ll parse the request and answers in the
form of json objects to the user who requested. This will then just be a problem of parsing and
displaying json objects and related images for user attraction. So, the development side would
be purely about following client server architecture.
